# To-Do List App (Work in Progress)

Hi there 👋  
I'm **Omar Abdelrady**, and this is my first full-stack project as I learn web development using **MERN stack** which you can call **DoRank**.

## Project Idea

The goal is to create a simple yet powerful To-Do List app — with features that (hopefully!) haven’t been seen before in similar apps.  
I'm experimenting with some unique ideas that could make task management more helpful and engaging.

## Current Status

🔧 Project is still in early development  
✅ So far:  
- React setup (frontend)  
- Express setup (backend)  

## Notes

- I'm still learning, so there might be some mistakes or things that need improvement.
- Feel free to share any feedback, suggestions, or tips — I’d really appreciate it! 🙌

## Thanks ❤️

Stay tuned — exciting features coming soon!
